# AT LAST THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR
Project submitted in PlutoHack contest, Oct 22-24, 2021
Brainstorm and implement:
# Inspiration:
Studying online during the pandemic, it is often difficult for students to find the right resources for them.
Some students are interested in learning with visuals, others are interested in learning through listening to lectures or reading materials and doing research.
# What it does:
This project allows teachers to deliver materials based on 4 different standards:
Virtual
Aural
Read and write
Kinesthetic
And allowing students to search documents also based on the above criteria for each different subject.
# How we built it:
We build it with some HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
It's still not perfect or pretty.
# Challenges we ran into:
It's our first time working together so there are still many problems in communication and ideation
Because of our limited knowledge, the product we created has not really been applied in practice.
# Accomplishments that we've proud to:
We learned how to use PHP and SQL for the first time.
We can do it through prototypes on Figma.
# What we learned:
We learned to support each other as a team.
# What's next for Untitled:
Maybe some improvement on the project or we will continue to work together in some other contest.
